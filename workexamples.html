              <p>This writing assignemnt is an example of a research paper written about plastic ways in the ocean based on  
              scholarly articles for a Composition class. First a proposal was written, then an annotaed bibliography before 
              the actual paper was completed. Lastly an infographic was designed based on the research paper. Below you can

              different aspects of database design with ER-modeling, Relational Schemas and SQL script to create, populate and use 
              the database. I created a soccer club database as I'm a soccer player myself and therefore have a deep understanding for

              <p> In my Human Computer Interface class I, together with two other group members designed and 
              built an interface using Java. The task was to build an interface that enabled users to add, modify and delete user and website data 
              for various websites. The class was all about making a computer interface interact well with humans, the users. I was 
              responsible for programming the adding and modifying user data (part a + b). Below is my groups final presentation that 
              won't show you the code but instead the final result of our interface. Our interface worked flawlessly and was recognized 
              as the best interface design and presentation in our class.

              <p>The assignment for this project was to create a 15 second long animated sequence with audio, that highlighted 
              two opposing themes. I decided to create an animation using Childish Gambino's song "This is America" to illustrate two 
              opposing sides that I, as an international, see living in the US. All the illustrations and graphic elements was made using illustrator 
              and the animation were created through After Effects.</p>
