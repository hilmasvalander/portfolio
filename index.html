            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
            <p>I am writing to you as I am interested in a position at your company. When it is suitable for you, I would greatly
            appreciate having the opportunity to discuss what my candidacy could bring to your company. Please see my attached resume.</p>
            <p>As a product owner for my own start-up mobile app company, I have experience of entrepreneurship, project management
            as well as system analysis and design. The mobile app was designed based on self-experienced problems faced as a high 
            school and college student-athlete. The development gave me experience in assessing needs from users and meet them with
            a smart software solution. Further I gained experience in agile project development that enhanced my communication and 
            problem solving abilities.</p>
            <p>Further, through my experience with my start-up business I know how to raise capital, gain user engagement and deliver
            effective marketing strategies. This has allowed me a broad knowledge in managing teams and a business which makes me ideal
            for positions within project management.</p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a B.S in Information Science and Minor in Digital Graphics at the University of Arkansas at Little
            Rock. Through my education I’ve become proficient in  Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Word and Excel. Together with
            my design proficiency in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and After effects, I can offer both the software development and analysis
            as well as UX/UI design.</p>
            <p>Through my experience I believe I can become a valuable team member at your company. I’m looking forward to meet with you to
            further discuss my candidacy. You can reach me through my email hilma@stateraapp.com and I’ll be at your convenience.</p>
            <p>Thank you for out time and consideration!</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
            <p>Hilma Svalander</p>
